# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

##### The purpose of this project was to create summary analysis for Louise so we can compare the fundraising results of her  play to other  similar campaigns over the course of a year.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

##### The most successful campaigns were in May, and the least successful campaigns were in December. There also appears to be a very high correlation between succeesful and failed campaigns. There were not a large amount of canceled campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

##### Campaigns with goals below $10000 were generally successful, with the campaigns with goals shy of $1000 being the most successful. The least successful campaigns were ones with goals between $45000 and $49999

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

##### Analysis is challenging for me - in the workplace even it is difficult for me to deliver data to stakeholders without either over-complicating the results or not explaining it throughly enough

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? Plays are more successful during Spring/Summer. When there are more successful campaigns there are also more failed campaigns

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Plays are more likely to be successful when the goal is below $20000

- What are some limitations of this dataset? We are only looking at data for one year. We are also not looking at who is making the plays (except for the blurb which does not have the names of play directors in it's own column so it's difficult to aggregate data by directors) or if specific play titles have previously been successful

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Perhaps projected outcomes for plays
